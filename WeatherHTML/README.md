In this assignment, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I created in my WeatherPy project. Specifically, I am  plotting weather data from 500+ cities that I accessed using the OpenWeatherAPI. 

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which you can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. It includes a landing page, a page where you can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where you can view the data used to build them.
