Hello! Please visit the WeatherHTML folder for my files (HTML, csv, css, and ipynb) on the Week 11 HTML homework. Go to https://cecind123.github.io/WeatherHTML/Web-Visualization.html for the landing page and navigate to the rest of the pages by clicking on the links or images on the landing page. 


The class_activities folder contains other various sites I am practicing HTML with.
