The catch is: Fiona's parents are unaware of the curse that struck their daughter and have assumed she married Prince Charming, not a 700-pound ogre with horrible hygiene and a talking donkey pal.</td>

The most-promising candidate is Princess Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) cousin Artie (Justin Timberlake), a teenage slacker in a medieval high-school.
